## Special Lagnas and Arudha Padas in Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra (BPHS)

According to Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, there are two main categories of specialized points used in Vedic astrology: **Special Lagnas (Vishesika Lagnas)** and **Arudha Padas (Bhava Padas)**. These tools provide deeper insights into various life aspects beyond what the natal ascendant alone reveals.

### Special Lagnas (Vishesika Lagnas)

BPHS Chapter 5 describes three primary special lagnas that are calculated based on time elapsed from sunrise:[1][2][3]

**1. Bhava Lagna**
From sunrise to the time of birth, every 5 Ghatis (120 minutes or 2 hours) constitutes one Bhava Lagna. This lagna represents the physical body and self, with emphasis on the material aspects of existence.[3][4][5]

**2. Hora Lagna (HL)**
Hora Lagna repeats itself every 2½ Ghatis (60 minutes or 1 hour) from sunrise. This is specifically used to analyze financial status, wealth accumulation, and material well-being of the individual. The strength of the Hora Lagna lord, along with the 2nd and 11th houses from it, indicates financial prosperity.[4][6][3]

**3. Ghatika Lagna (GL) / Ghati Lagna**
The most precise of the three, Ghatika Lagna is calculated based on the Ghati system (one Ghati equals 24 minutes). It reveals power, authority, fame, achievements, and one's position in society. The calculation involves converting the time from sunrise into Rasis (signs) and Palas (degrees), then adding this to the Sun's longitude at sunrise.[7][8][3]

### Additional Special Lagnas

Beyond these three primary special lagnas, BPHS and related classical texts mention several other specialized ascendants:[6][9][4]

**4. Indu Lagna**
Calculated from the 9th house lord positions from both Lagna and Moon. It is one of the most important features for judging wealth and financial prosperity in a chart.[10][11][12]

**5. Pranapada Lagna**
Calculated by converting the birth time into Vighatis (1 Vighati = 24 seconds) and dividing by 15. The result is added to the Sun's position, with adjustments based on whether the Sun occupies a movable, fixed, or dual sign. Pranapada relates to the breathing pattern and life force (prana) of the native, indicating physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health. Pranapada placement in the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 10th, or 11th houses from the ascendant is considered auspicious.[13][14][15][16]

**6. Varnada Lagna**
Calculated from Hora Lagna and the natal Lagna, Varnada shows the "color" or mood one will occupy to sustain themselves in society. It represents the karma yoga and indicates the varna (social class) through which one earns their livelihood. Varnada is calculated by counting signs (not longitudes) from Aries or Pisces depending on whether the signs are odd or even.[17][18][19][20]

**7. Sree Lagna (Sri Lagna)**
Mentioned as one of the important lagnas for judging Raja (power) and Dhana (wealth) yogas.[21]

**8. Tripravana Lagna**
Used in Jaimini astrology for assessing status and wealth-related yogas.[21]

### The 12 Arudha Padas (Bhava Padas)

BPHS Chapters 29 and 30 comprehensively describe the Arudha Pada system. Arudha means "image" or "reflection" and represents how the world perceives various aspects of one's life. Each of the 12 houses has a corresponding Arudha Pada.[22][23][24][25][21]

#### Calculation Method

The pada of any house (bhava) is calculated as follows:[23][25][22]

1. Note the position of the house lord
2. Count the number of houses from the bhava to its lord
3. Count the same number of houses from the lord
4. The resulting sign is the Arudha Pada of that house

**Special Exceptions:**
- If the Arudha falls in the same house or the 7th from it, count 10 houses from that intermediate result[26][22][23]
- If the lord of a house is in the 4th from it, the 4th house itself becomes the Arudha[23]
- If the lord is in the 7th from the house, the 10th becomes the Arudha[23]

#### The 12 Arudha Padas and Their Names

**A1 - Lagna Pada / Arudha Lagna (AL)**
The Arudha of the 1st house, representing public image, social identity, and how others perceive the native. This is the most important Arudha after the natal ascendant.[25][27][22][21][23]

**A2 - Dhana Pada / Vitta Pada**
The Arudha of the 2nd house, indicating perceived wealth, family image, and financial reputation.[27][22][21]

**A3 - Vikrama Pada / Bhratru Pada**
The Arudha of the 3rd house, representing perceived courage, communication skills, and relationship with siblings.[22][27][21]

**A4 - Matru Pada / Sukha Pada**
The Arudha of the 4th house, showing public perception of one's home, mother, vehicles, and domestic happiness.[28][27][21][22]

**A5 - Mantra Pada / Putra Pada / Vidya Pada**
The Arudha of the 5th house, indicating perceived intelligence, creativity, children, romantic relationships, and speculative abilities.[24][29][27][28][21][22]

**A6 - Roga Pada / Satru Pada**
The Arudha of the 6th house, representing perceived health issues, enemies, debts, and service.[29][27][28][21][22]

**A7 - Dara Pada / Kalatra Pada**
The Arudha of the 7th house, showing public perception of one's spouse, partnerships, and marital happiness.[27][28][29][21][22]

**A8 - Marana Pada / Mrityu Pada / Randhra Pada**
The Arudha of the 8th house, indicating perceived transformations, occult knowledge, inheritance, and longevity.[28][29][21][22][27]

**A9 - Pitru Pada / Bhagya Pada / Dharma Pada**
The Arudha of the 9th house, representing perceived fortune, father's status, religious inclinations, and higher learning.[29][21][22][27][28]

**A10 - Karma Pada / Rajya Pada / Swarga Pada**
The Arudha of the 10th house, showing professional reputation, career status, and public recognition.[30][21][22][27][28][29]

**A11 - Labha Pada**
The Arudha of the 11th house, indicating perceived gains, income sources, and social networks.[21][22][27][28][29]

**A12 - Upapada / Gauna Pada / Vyaya Pada**
The Arudha of the 12th house, representing the inner attitude toward the spouse, spiritual inclinations, expenses, and losses. This is the second most important Arudha after Arudha Lagna.[31][32][33][26][22][27][28][29][21]

### Special Significance of Upapada (A12)

Upapada deserves special mention as BPHS dedicates an entire chapter (Chapter 30) to it. Also called Gauna Pada (meaning "that which follows"), Upapada reveals:[32][33][26][31]

- The native's inner attitude and feelings toward the spouse
- Marriage prospects and timing
- Quality of married life
- Nature of relationships
- Subsequent marriages (calculated as the 8th from previous Upapada)[26]

According to BPHS, if the lord of Upapada goes to the 12th from it, this indicates denial or significant delays in marriage.[31]

### Usage of Special Lagnas and Arudhas

BPHS explicitly states that these special lagnas and arudhas should be treated as independent ascendants:[4][6][21]

1. Prepare separate charts for each special lagna and arudha
2. Count houses from them as you would from the natal ascendant
3. Apply the same predictive principles (house significations, planetary yogas, aspects)
4. Analyze planets placed in or aspecting these special points
5. Benefics in kendras (angles) and trikonas (trines) from special lagnas bring positive results for that lagna's significations
6. Malefics similarly placed bring challenges in those areas[6][4]

The sage emphasizes that a comprehensive horoscope analysis requires examining the natal Lagna along with Moon Lagna, Sun Lagna, and these special lagnas together. The final bhava (house) chart should emerge after merging the different bhava charts caused by these various special ascendants.[34][1][6]

This multi-layered approach enables astrologers to assess not just the inherent nature of events, but also their timing, intensity, and manifestation in the native's life, providing a complete picture that would be impossible to achieve through the natal chart alone.
